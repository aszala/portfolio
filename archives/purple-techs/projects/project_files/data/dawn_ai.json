	"updated": "8/10/19",
	"objective" : "Dawn is an Artifical Intelligence that is designed to provide me with a virtual assistant that is more powerful than Google Home or Amazon Alexa. While large companies are limited on how much functionality they can provide do to legality and privacy issues as well as making a product that will sell to a large number of people. Dawn is not designed to be sold out to the general public and is only intended for me and potential a few people who are close to me. This allows Dawn to do much more than Google or Amazon. Dawn is currently being developed in Python and JavaScript.",
	"results" : "Dawn is a project that I will be working on for several years and thus will be an ongoing project. At the moment Dawn can fully integrate itself into my local computers, my private server, any Google Products, and my Github. The goal would be that in the near future it will be able to integrate into my other accounts and devices, as well as becoming integrated with my Presentation AI. Using IBM Watson Dawn can handle natural speech interpretation as well as able to speak in an almost natural sounding human voice. Recently Dawn obtained the ability to understand hand motions. Using OpenCV, Tensorflow, Machine Learning and Computer Vision, Dawn can understand simple actions with my hands. Using these hand gestures, Dawn can perform actions on any of the services that it is integrated with. Dawn is also able to understand faces and perform different reactions depending on the face that it sees.",
	"learned" : "Just as this project is still ongoing, the new information that I am learning from the project is also still ongoing. I have already learned a lot regarding Artifical Intelligence and the applications of Python and JavaScript. I have also learned how to connect existing software in the world with software of my making."
