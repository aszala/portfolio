	"objective" : "I often build games for my entertainment. Many of these games were never shared and typical are never finished but they serve as a form of entertainment from which I can practice and develop my skills while also having some fun. After building several of these games I realized I lost a lot of time writing very similar code, Code to render, detect collisions, etc, the things that all games have. So instead of having to write all this code again, I decided to create a Game Engine from which I could reduce the amount of time spent writing the same code again. I develop these quick games in Java as it is my favorite language so, I also choose to use Java for this Game Engine.",
	"results" : "The resulting Game Engine was very simple and only allowed for small games. However, I ended up using it for the later project <a href='project.php?project=milkshake_guardian'>Milkshake Guardian</a>. The Game Engine allowed me to create quick levels and setup players as well as enemies and obstacles. The Engine only supported 2D games as 3D is very difficult to do in Java without the use of other APIs such as OpenGL. In the future, I plan to update the Engine so larger-scale games can be built, and the Engine could potentially be used by other than just me.",
	"learned" : "Through this project, I was able to further develop my Java skills. I had to learn to better render and calculate things such as collisions and how to apply physics to objects in my game. After the completion of this project, I have a better understanding of Java 2D graphics and more efficient methods of calculation."
