	"title" : "Research: Implementation Of Genetic Algorithms In Industrial Practices",
	"updated": "2/10/19",
	"objective" : "This project was part of the TEAMS state competition. The objective was to research potential uses of AI in the future. My group and I went with implementing genetically learning AI into modern-day industrial practices.",
	"results" : "We wrote a paper on the benefits and downsides of this idea. While having AI provided many benefits in profits, fewer mistakes, and other things, it also provided a major downside for people as it would put many people of jobs. The initial cost of implementing and then maintaining the AI would also be high.",
	"learned" : "Through this research, I was able to further extend knowledge on genetic algorithms and how industrial processes work in our modern-day. I was also able to learn more about the impact of technology growth on the economy and how AI and automation pose a real risk to blue-collar jobs."
