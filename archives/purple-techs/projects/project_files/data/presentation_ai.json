	"objective" : "Presenting to people is something that happens to hundreds of people every day. People present on large scales like during conferences or TED talks and people present on a small scale like for a school project. Something common between these presenters is that in whatever presentation software they use, PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc, is that they must often pause or break the flow to continue with their presentation. For very skilled presenters this is not as much as a problem however if they are using a computer to move the presentation then they must stand next to their computer the whole time and if they are using a clicker then they must have something in their hands at all times. Even worse is when there is a question regarding a certain topic and then the presenter must click through their slides until they reach the location of the topic of the question. This ruins the flow of the presentation and often leaves times where no one is saying anything. The goal of this project was to solve this problem using Artifical Intelligence.",
	"results" : "While this project has been completed it is being redone to become integrated with my <a href='project.php?project=dawn_ai'>Dawn AI</a>. and to work better. Using Microsoft's speech recognition API's, This Artifical Intelligence will listen to the presenter's speech and control the presentation according. The AI analyzes the presentation when it starts and then as the speaker talks to compares the speaker's speech to the presentation and then moves the presentation accordingly to match. If a question is asked regarding a certain topic and the presenter starts answer then the AI will immediately change to the correct location in the presentation. This helps prevent interruptions and allows the presenter to roam the stage as they please, and they no longer need to hold anything in their hands. This AI was developed at the NC State PackHacks Hackathon and won 1st place for the High School Division.",
	"learned" : "Through this project, I was able to expand my knowledge of speech recognition and integration of AI into presentation software. The project was developed in C#, and while that is not the ideal programming language for AI development, the ultimate goal was to expand my knowledge. As stated above the project is being redone using Python for integration with <a href='project.php?project=dawn_ai'>Dawn AI</a>."
