	"objective" : "This is a game in which 2 AI's are pitted against each other in RTS style battle. The goal is to have 2 players develop an AI in a very simple manner, such that even if the players have very little programming skill they are still able to participate. The players would then submit their AI and the AI's would then battle it out to see which was better. The objective was to create a fun way for people to be introduced to AI. Eventually, if the game is stable enough then I would try to start a club or organization in which people could use.",
	"results" : "The game was successfully built. It took several iterations. Every year of my high school I built a new more efficient and stable version. The final and most recent version of the game is by far the best and is stable enough for people to use. To make AI development easy, I built a wrapper for Java so that people can use Java syntax and using simple commands and action be able to make an AI that was complex enough to play an RTS game. While I never got around to making a club or organization I hope that sometime in the future if enough people show support for it, then I will be able to make a club or organization.",
	"learned" : "The entire project was developed in Java. Each time I built a new version of the game, I was able to expand my knowledge on efficient Java programming as well as learning more about Java Graphics. The final result of the game contained code that was some of the most effecient I had written at the time. Despite not using a GPU for rendering, the game still only used minimal CPU and RAM while running smoothly."
