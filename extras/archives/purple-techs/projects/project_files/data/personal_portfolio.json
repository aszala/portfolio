	"objective" : "Many of my projects have never been shown outside my close circle of people I know. The issue with this is that many people are never able to see any my work and as they say 'Seeing is believing'. I can that I have done things but it was very hard to prove this to people that I haven't shown my projects to. The goal of this Portfolio is to allow others to see the work that I have done and it allows me to justify many of my claims.",
	"results" : "This entire website was developed from scratch and hosted on my private server. No website builder, no templates. This result of not using any website builder or any template is that I am also able to show off my web development and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. This website will always be a work in progress as I am always working on new projects, and as I get time I am trying to update and add them on this website.",
	"learned" : "While I did not learn much from the creation of this website, it has allowed me to practice my web development skills."
