	"title" : "Reverse Osmosis Bottle For Impoverished Nations",
	"updated": "6/28/17",
	"objective" : "Drinking water is something that all humans need to survive. There are many countries that are unable to provide clean water to their people and many people who live in far-out villages rarely have access to safe water. The goal of this project was to design a cheap and effective solution to this issue. This was a group project.",
	"results" : "We decided to build a small portable bottle that would use the process of reverse osmosis to purify water cheaply. We developed a prototype bottle that once filled with water, would use a thin membrane to clean the water with reverse osmosis and then would use a turbine to push water up to a little drinking hole. From the drinking hole, the user can drink the cleaned water. With this project we won 3rd at the state level and top 12 at the national level.",
	"learned" : "Through this project, I was able to learn more about the state of countries that are poor and the effect on the people and how people in places that are far from clean water are affected. I was also able to learn about the process of reverse osmosis and how it can help clean water."
